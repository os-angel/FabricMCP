# FabricMCP
I built an MCP server connecting Microsoft Fabric with Claude Desktop, letting me manage Power BI through natural language instead of complex interfaces. Sharing my complete Python implementation with FastMCP - now I just ask Claude to manage workspaces, run DAX queries, or add users conversationally.
